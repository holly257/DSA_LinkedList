# Linked Lists

## In these drills, you'll practice creating a linked list, implementing its core, and some supplemental operations. You will also use your linked list to solve interview questions. Don't forget to assess the big O for each of these exercises. Start each problem by stating 1 or more sample inputs and outputs.

1. Create a linked list class, including insertFirst, insertLast, remove, find. 
2. Creating a singly linked list
    - Write a function main. Within the function, using the linked list class above, create a linked list with the name SLL and add the following items to your linked list: Apollo, Boomer, Helo, Husker, Starbuck.
    - Add Tauhida to the list.
    - Remove Husker from the list.
    - Implement a function called insertBefore() in the class that inserts a new node before a given node containing a key.
    - Implement a function called insertAfter() in the class that inserts a new node after a node containing the key.
    - Implement a function called insertAt() that inserts an item at a specific position in the linked list.
    - Add Athena before Boomer using your insertBefore() function.
    - Add Hotdog after Helo using the insertAfter() method.

    - ##### in progress: insertAt()
    - Using the insertAt() method insert Kat in the 3rd position of the list.
    - Remove Tauhida from the list.
